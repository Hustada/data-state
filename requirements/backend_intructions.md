# Code Snippets

### Fetching and Processing CSV Data with Pandas

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Load CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('campaign_data.csv')

# Process data
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df['amount'] = df['amount'].astype(float)

# Save to PostgreSQL
engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname')
df.to_sql('campaign_contributions', engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

### Displaying Data with D3.js

```javascript
// Sample code to create a simple bar chart
const data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

const svg = d3.select("body")
  .append("svg")
  .attr("width", 500)
  .attr("height", 300);

svg.selectAll("rect")
  .data(data)
  .enter()
  .append("rect")
  .attr("x", (d, i) => i * 70)
  .attr("y", (d) => 300 - d * 3)
  .attr("width", 65)
  .attr("height", (d) => d * 3)
  .attr("fill", "steelblue");
```

# Mobile-Specific Considerations

- **Responsive Design:** Use CSS media queries and flexbox in Tailwind CSS to ensure the application is mobile-friendly.
- **Touch Interactions:** Optimize UI components for touch interactions, such as larger buttons and swipe gestures.
- **Native App Alternative:** Consider developing a native mobile app using React Native if a more tailored mobile experience is desired.

**Unique Aspects:**
- Interactive visualizations and AI-generated insights.
- Automated data updates and user-friendly interface.
- Focus on making complex data accessible to the public.

# Future Enhancement Roadmap
