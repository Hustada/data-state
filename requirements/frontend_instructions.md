# Code Snippets

```python

# Example of fetching and processing data from an API

import requests
import pandas as pd

def fetch_and_process_data(api_url):
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    data = response.json()
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    # Process data here
    return df

# Example of using Celery to schedule a task

from celery import Celery

app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

@app.task
def update_data():
    # Code to update data goes here
    print("Data updated")
```

# Mobile-Specific Considerations

- **API Design**: Ensure API endpoints are optimized for mobile use, with efficient data transfer and processing.
